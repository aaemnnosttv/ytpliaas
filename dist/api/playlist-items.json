She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner (Matthew Davis) from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. Growing up across the street from Aaron Spelling might mean something in LA, but nothing to Warner's East-Coast blue blood family. So, when Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. But law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside and the mall. Elle must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes who suffer endless indignities everyday.",

            "description": "Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale star in an explosive action-packed adventure with bone-charring special effects that will have you glued to your seat! When workers in a London tunneling project awaken an unearthly fire-breathing beast from centuries of slumber, all hell breaks loose. Twelve-year-old Quinn (Bale) sees his mother, one of the workers, die trying to escape this new terror. Twenty years later as a \"fire chief,\" he tries to keep a group of refugees alive with fierce dragons dominating the air, burning the land and feeding on the ash. Unexpectedly, Van Zan (McConaughey), a hotshot American militia leader, shows up with a ragtag group of slayers on a perilous crusade to hunt down and destroy the beasts. Tempers flare when there is a struggle for leadership -- until both men realize only one species is getting out of this alive.",

            "title": "Small Soldiers",
            "description": "Joe Dante directed this satirical action-comedy about talking tech toys accidentally juiced-up with military microchips. After the defense industry firm Globotech takes over a small toy company, Heartland Play Systems' CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) gives the green light to develop a new line of action figures, requesting an upgrade to more realistic figures from Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and fumbling Irwin Wayfair (David Cross). Mars wants toys that act like the ones in TV commercials. The results are fierce fighting figures, the Commando Elite, programmed to seek out and destroy the kindly alien-like Gorgonites. In an effort to make the toys as natural as possible, Benson inserts Globotech's most powerful military computer chips. Meanwhile, in quiet Winslow Corners, Ohio, toy-store owner Stuart Abernathy (Kevin Dunn) and his 15-year-old son Alan (Gregory Smith) are stuck in a failing business, so when Heartland truckdriver Joe (Dick Miller) stops by with the Commando and Gorgonite toys, Alan is convinced they will be hot sellers, commenting, \"Maybe this store will finally make a little money.\" With blistering blows to their blister packs, the Commandos burst out, receive orders from their leader Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) and ready for an all-out assault on the Gorgonites. When the Gorgonite leader Archer (voice of Frank Langella) begins communicating with Alan, it causes the Commandos to perceive humans as another enemy, simply by their association with the \"Gorgonite scum,\" so an attack on the Abernathy house begins. Unfortunately, the Gorgonites can offer only limited assistance, since they have been programmed to lose. The film combines animatronics, puppetry, and computer animation. The Commando Elite voices include surviving actors from Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen (1967), while the Gorgonite voices reunited several This Is Spinal Tap (1983) cast members. A dedication to Phil Hartman (the voice of Phil Fimple) after the closing credits features a brief Hartman outtake.",

For 14-year old Walter (Haley Joel Osment), his great uncles' farm in rural Texas is the last place on earth he wants to spend the summer. Eccentric and gruff Hub and Garth McCaan (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) are rumored to have been bank robbers, mafia hit men and/or war criminals in their younger days. But little by little, through stories spun against a backdrop of the dusty Texas night, an amazing tale comes to life via Walter's vivid, colorful imaginings--a tale set in a long-ago exotic, mysterious place where men rode stallions and fought with swords; where beautiful princesses tangled with treacherous sheiks; and where the two unlikely heroes lived an adventure of which most people only dream.",

After being shot at by military guards, Klaatu is brought to a Washington, D.C. hospital, where he begs a sympathetic but frank Major White (Robert Osterloh) to gather all the world's leaders so he can tell them more specifically what he has come to warn them about. Losing patience, Klaatu slips into the human world, adapting a false identity and living at a boarding house where he meets a smart woman with a conscience and her inquisitive son. Both mother and son soon find themselves embroiled in the complex mystery of Klaatu, his message and the government's witch hunt for the alien.  Seen by many as a political, religious and humanitarian effort, the film is based on Harry Bates' story, \"Farewell to the Master.\"",

Struggling black comic Lance Barton (Rock) knows what it's like to die on stage. But when his life takes an unexpected turn - straight to heaven - Lance is sure there's been a mistake. Miraculously, he's right! An angel tells Lance he was taken prematurely but assures him he can be returned to Earth - in the aged body of a ruthless white billionaire. In this improbable reincarnation, Lance begins a hilarious quest to realize his showbiz dream...and, along the way, discovers the person he never imagined he could be. Co-starring Regina King and based on the hit film Heaven Can Wait, Down To Earth is a \"bold and brilliant comedy.\"** *Shawn Edwards, FOX-TV **Kimberly C. Roberts, THE PHILADELPHIA TRIBUNE",

As the summer before their 16th birthdays approaches, these four best friends with diverse family backgrounds and personalities hatch a plan to stay connected despite being separated for the entire season.

Over the summer, the pants come to represent the girls' mutual support of one another. But the jeans also lead each teenager into bruising yet ultimately healing confrontations with love and courage, death and forgiveness, in the days of The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants.",

Otto Preminger's epic motion picture dramatically chronicles Israel's struggle for liberation during this troubled time... As these events and struggles occur, there is a migration of European Jews (the ragged survivors of Hitler's death camps) to the New Land--aboard the refugee ship Exodus, which has been barricaded in a Cyprus harbor by British warships. After a hunger strike by its 611 passengers, the British authorities relent and allow the vessel to sail to Palestine. The second section of the film deals with the struggle of the Jews in Palestine to gain partition, and the final segment the struggle of the main characters in post-partition Palestine to help Israel stay alive as a nation.",

            "description": "Robert Redford stars in this action drama as General Irwin, a respected three-star tactician whose career ends in disgrace when he's court-martialed and sent to The Castle, a maximum security military prison. Irwin quickly butts heads with the facility's autocratic warden, Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), who runs his command with an iron fist, even killing prisoners when he deems it necessary. Irwin rallies his fellow convicts into a rag-tag army and leads them in a revolt against Winter, an action that the warden is ready to repel by violent means. Mark Ruffalo, Robin Wright Penn, and Delroy Lindo co-star in this Dreamworks production, the third feature film from one-time film critic Rod Lurie.",

But his ruthless rival; Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef; \"High Noon\"); is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive! Failing to capture their prey – or eliminate each other – the two are left with only one option: team up; or face certain death at the hands of Indio and his band of murderous outlaws!",

George has become Lennie's protector.  Although retarded, Lennie is a willing, strong worker, and between them they expect to earn enough money to buy their own small piece of land.  Lennie's strength is also his curse.  He has a childlike attachment to small animals, but often crushes them to death.  And women, to Lennie, are like soft, small and gentle animals. The tragedy that will emerge from this fact will involve an exploited and misused woman (Sherilyn Fenn).",

This holiday season, Susan is going to receive the most precious gift of all: something to believe in.  And she's about to discover that miracles do occur...The story relates the arrival of one Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough), a department store Santa who believes he's the genuine article, and who subsequently turns a skeptical child's world upside-down. When Kris is put on trial to prove he's Santa, the youngster -- and everyone around her -- learns the true meaning of faith, the importance of family... and that even today, we all need something to believe in.",

But when skirmishes with the enemy lead to U.S. snipers being killed by a ghost shooter who locks into their exact location, a security breach is suspected. Fingers are pointed and battle lines are drawn, all leading up to an explosive climax.",

            "description": "From the director of Arlington Road comes a spine-tingling, super-natural thriller based on actual events that will rattle your nerves and shake your beliefs. Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being can predict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted? His life, and potentially others' lives, depend on his making the right choice before time runs out. (Original TItle - The Mothman Prophecies) © 2002 Lakeshore Entertainment Corp.

The merchant’s youngest daughter Belle (Léa Seydoux, Spectre) bravely sacrifices herself and takes her father’s place. Once at the Beast’s castle, it is not death that awaits Belle, but a strange and fantastical life unlike anything she has ever experienced…and the discovery that her mysterious host is living under a terrible enchantment. As Belle valiantly attempts to release the Beast from his curse, the two discover that a most unlikely bond blooms between them…true love.\nVisually stunning and magnificently produced, Beauty And The Beast (La Belle Et La Bête) is a rich and thoroughly modern interpretation of one of the world’s most beloved stories, artfully told by director Christophe Gans.",

Lancaster seeks the aid of local sheriff Robert Ryan, but Ryan and the local citizens try to divert Lancaster from his task because the killing was clearly an accident and because they are under the powerful sway of the boss of the hired hands, Lee J. Cobb. Lancaster tries to cut a deal with Cobb, but Cobb's hired hands, believing that it is impossible to reason with the fanatical Lancaster, goad him into a gunfight in which Lancaster kills the ranch foreman.  Lancaster will pursue the fleeing felons to an absolute point of no return in which only blood and death can be the victors. Robert Duvall/Sheree North/Richard Jordan/John Hillerman co-star.",

            "description": "The 300 Spartans is an account of the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, in which the Spartan King Leonidis, played by Richard Egan, led a remarkably small number of men to victory over an invading Persian army led by evil King Xerxes that was about 20 times as large. This spectacular conflict gave the Grecians enough time to organize a force to ultimately repel the Persians, and thus change the course of Western civilization. The film was directed by Rudolph Mate and stars Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson.",

When a psychopathic teenage killer robs a bank, wounds Van Cleef and then kidnaps, sexually molests and kills his wife (Mariette Hartley), Van Cleef's 'peaceful' life is destroyed. He accepts a new 'mercenary' assignment: to protect a small Mexican town from a vicious gang that has already killed all the men in the town.  Van Cleef recruits five convicts (Luke Askew, Pedro Armendariz, Jr., William Lucking, James B.

Among the distressed women welcoming the guns of the 'Seven' are Stefanie Powers and Melissa Murphy.  Music by Elmer Bernstein.",

This movie is extremely alarming, an expression which here means \"a thrilling misadventure involving three ingenious orphans and a villionous actor named Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who wants their enormous fortune.\" It includes a suspicious fire, delicious pasta, Jim Carrey, poorly behaved looches, Billy Connolly, an incredibly deadly viper, Meryl Streep, and the voice of an imposter named Jude Law. The only things that could make such a spectatcle more upsetting are special features, such a scommentary by me or outtakes involving nervous laughter. I am bound to continue my research into the lives of the Baudelelaire orphans, but you are free to seek lighter fare, like bleu cheese fondue. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket.",

Feeling obligated to support their endeavor, she agrees to let them match her. After two dates with completely incompatible men, Dylan and Ariela match Liz with the school's single, attractive track coach Ted, whom she can't stand.

With record bounties on their heads, they are forced to escape through barren and harsh terrain, even if it costs them their lives. As their options dwindle, they stumble upon the lone, unassuming farmhouse of the Tildon family. Without the means to defend themselves, George, his wife Ada, and their two daughters must survive the night with the outlaws and keep their captors at bay; the delicate dance is further complicated when Henry falls for the youngest daughter, Florence, a spitfire who is struggling with frontier life. Secrets are revealed, allegiances are tested, and the line between good and evil begins to blur. As the story builds towards its inevitably brutal climax and twist ending, it becomes obvious Florence is the family's only hope for a happy ending... if there ever was one.",

            "description": "Critics have called it \"OPEN WATER on a ski lift\" and \"JAWS in the snow.\" It remains perhaps the most intense and terrifying film of the year: As Sunday evening falls, three snowboarding friends decide to take one last run down the slope. Halfway up the mountain, their chair lift stops, the lights go out and the resort closes for the week. They are stranded, but the worst is still to come. A storm is approaching. Frostbite is setting in. And on the ground below them, a pack of hungry wolves has gathered to wait. Kevin Zegers (DAWN OF THE DEAD, WRONG TURN), Shawn Ashmore (X-MEN, THE RUINS) and Emma Bell star in the relentlessly chilling thriller from writer/director Adam Green (HATCHET) that Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News hails as \"a vicious, scary and horrifying experience...FROZEN is a howling good time!\"",

            "description": "Stanley (Robert De Niro), an odd-job worker, has grown up unable to read.  Iris (Jane Fonda), a working-class mother and widow, is trapped in a job squirting goo on cookies in a bakery, while supporting a pregnant teenager, an abused sister and a grieving son.  Then she meets Stanley, who supports his aging father.  Iris lets it slip that Stanley is illiterate, and he is fired.  Unable to support his father, the old man is put in a home where he fades rapidly.  Realizing that if he had only been able to read he could have continued to support his father, Stanley asks Iris to teach him to read.  It's a tough road for both of them: Stanley has real learning problems, and Iris does not exactly have a load of extra time on her hands.  But they will make it...a small but triumphant victory in a gray world.",

            "description": "Jason thought his inheritance was going to be the gift of money and lots of it. Was he ever in for a big surprise. Based on the best-selling book \"The Ultimate Gift\" by Jim Stovall, the story sends trust fund baby Jason Stevens on an improbable journey of discovery, having to answer the ultimate question: \"What is the relationship between wealth and happiness?\" Jason had a very simple relationship with his impossibly wealthy Grandfather, Howard \"Red\" Stevens. He hated him. No heart-to-heart talks, no warm fuzzies, just cold hard cash. So of course he figured that when Red died, the whole \"reading of the will\" thing would be another simple cash transaction, that his Grandfather's money would allow him to continue living in the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. But what Red left him was anything but simple. Red instead devised a plan for Jason to experience a crash course on life. Twelve tasks, which Red calls \"gifts,\" each challenging Jason in an improbable way, the accumulation of which would change him forever.",

Valdez Is Coming boldly recreates America's western frontier, a place where life was sometimes cheap... but honor was always priceless. When it comes to keeping the peace, former frontier sheriff Bob Valdez has always been the voice of reason in a sea of chaos. But Frank Tanner (Jon Cypher) is a very different sort of man: greedy, impulsive and rotten to the core. So when Tanner provokes a shootout that results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez orders him to provide financial support for the widow. But when Tanner not only refuses but also laughs in his face, Valdez dusts off his old uniform, straps on his guns and vows to exact justice and vengeance at any cost.",

            "description": "Mrs. Brisby, a widowed mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbon farm. She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, yet plot to kill Nicodemus during the move.",

Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) is still haunted by her failure to save the life of a missing child from the hands of two young girls. Eight years later, another child goes missing in the same town just days after Ronnie and Alice (Dakota Fanning and newcomer Danielle Macdonald), the two girls convicted of the former crime, were released from juvenile detention. Porter and her partner (Nate Parker) must race against the clock to prevent history from repeating itself. But as they begin to investigate the girls and their families, especially Alice's protective mother (Diane Lane), they unearth a web of secrets and deceptions that calls everything into question.",

            "description": "Behind ever great man there lies a teacher, and this was certainly true of Bruce Lee, who claimed as his mentor a martial arts expert named Ip Man (1893-1972). A genius of Wushu (or the Chinese martial arts school), Ip Man (Donnie Yen) grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung-fun warriors - ultimately training martial arts icons such as Bruce Lee. This biopic from director Wilson Yip dramatizes Ip's life story.",

Inspired by true events, the film follows three characters and three story lines that all come together during a random encounter in a small Northern Idaho town. The film wastes no time testing the lines between anger, redemption, and revenge in today's politically divided and socially tribal environment. What really makes these true-to-life characters tick is highlighted by suspense that keeps the audience guessing from the opening credits.",

Gillespie's (O'Connor) term as County Sheriff is coming to an end, and his enemies have found a local businessman, Kerry Madigan (John Calvin), who has high political aspiration, to run against him. They even attempt to enlist Forbes' (Weathers) support and the support of the local press in painting an unfavorable picture of Gillespie. Meanwhile, the police suspect Frank Cole (Corbin Bernsen), one of Madigan's employees, of murdering a pregnant woman. When they request a warrant to test Cole's blood for a DNA match of the dead woman's baby, the judge, who respects Madigan and his employees, is unwilling to approve it.

With dynamic music, including EU's hit \"Da Butt\", and dance numbers choreographed by Otis Sallid (Fame), Lee successfully challenges viewpoints about self-identity and self-esteem in this original, contemporary musical comedy.",

When a mysterious stranger (Bruce Dern) offers her a glimpse of what's really happening outside, Chloe soon finds that while the truth isn't so simple, the danger is very real.",

Things turn ugly when the stagecoach is hijacked by three thieves whose leader, Usher (Richard Boone), thinks nothing of killing the driver. To spare his own life, the cowardly Willard lets Usher know that, as the daughter of a wealthy copper miner, Doretta could bring a huge ransom. Before leaving to collect the cash, Usher kills Willard. But after Brennan takes out his two henchmen, to protect Doretta, he's forced into a deadly showdown once Usher returns.

They soon realize they’re trapped inside the movie and must team up with the horny, Reagan-era idiot “Camp bloodbath” counselors – including Max’s mom as the shy scream queen – to battle the film’s machete-wielding killer Billy Murphy. Face to face with her mother for the first time in years, Max has a second chance not only to see her, but to save her, and with the help of her friends, get back home before Billy kills them all. Also starring Adam DeVine, Thomas Middleditch, Alia Shawkat, Angela Trimbur, with Alexander Ludwig and Nina Dobrev.",

            "description": "Inspired by a true story set in Victorian England, a tale charting the life of Beatrix Potter--a literary phenomenon of the early 20th century. At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage, Beatrix became an iconic figure, swimming quietly, but with great fortitude, against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago, and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and--had she been a man--her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust, the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter's day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation.",

            "description": "Siren Phillips has lived her life thinking she's an ordinary girl, in an ordinary town. On the eve of her twelfth birthday, however, she learns that she is far from ordinary. Destined to turn into a Mermaid at the age of twelve, Siren must struggle with her new reality, saying good bye to her mother and friends, while she transitions into the water. To make matters worse, a group of Hunters are after her, trying to catch her. She soon becomes friends with Adam Wilts, a new boy at school, who she turns to for help. He agrees to help her, but finds himself caught in the middle, when it's his own father who is after Siren. When Siren's mother is taken, the town must rally behind her, and help her make a peaceful transition into the water, before the hunters can find out where she is.",

            "description": "While the rest of his high school graduating class is heading to the same old grind of college, skateboarder Eric Rivers and his best friends, Dustin, a goal-oriented workaholic, and misfit slacker Matt have one last summer roadtrip together to follow their dream of getting noticed by the professional skateboarding world--and getting paid to skate. When skating legend Jimmy Wilson's skate demo tour hits town, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned skate team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Jimmy's road manager and they can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. But they do get some free advice: keep skating, stay true to yourself, and stay in the game--if you're good, you'll get noticed. Following their dream-- and Jimmy's national tour--Eric, Dustin and Matt start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund. After recruiting laid-back ladies man Sweet Lou to join their crew and provide the wheels for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chi-town to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody skaters, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acuña, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.",

Former police detective David Paulides was initially brought on to investigate the circumstances around the many mysterious disappearances - here he presents the haunting true stories of hunters experiencing the unexplainable. Missing 411: The Hunted is based on the book by Paulides, which documents 185 cases of missing peoples from four different countries. All 185 cases fit a narrowly defined profile that was refined after researching thousands of missing person reports; these cases are the most difficult, defy common sense, challenge conventional wisdom and remain unexplained.",

She is too busy juggling work, bills, and the very married Dr. Hartford (Matthew Modine), to give her daughter, Ansiedad (Cierra Ramirez) the attention she desperately needs. When Ansiedad's English teacher, Ms. Armstrong (Patricia Arquette), introduces her students to classic coming-of-age stories, Ansiedad is inspired to skip adolescence and jump-start her life without mom. While Grace becomes preoccupied with the increasing affections of her co-worker (Eugenio Derbez), Ansiedad enlists the help of her loyal friend, Tavita (Raini Rodriguez), to plot her shortcut to \"adulthood\". But as her misguided plan unravels, Ansiedad and Grace must learn that sometimes growing-up means acting your age.",

When a hip-hop battle gone wrong throws these two artists together, they immediately clash but can’t deny it when sparks begin to fly. Their lives quickly get entangled in the pitfalls that come with competing in New York City. With the help of a dynamic dance crew called The SwitchSteps, Ruby and Johnnie must find a way to save Ruby’s scholarship and keep Johnnie from being deported. \n  \nIn an action-packed extravaganza combining cutting edge hip-hop with contemporary and classical dance, the two must navigate their opposing worlds and prepare for a competition where winning or losing will change their lives forever.",

            "description": "From acclaimed director Jacques Audiard (Rust and Bone, A Prophet), and based on the novel by Patrick deWitt, THE SISTERS BROTHERS is a reimagining of the cinematic Western as a dangerous, witty, and emotionally cathartic exploration of what it means to be a man. It is 1851, and Charlie and Eli Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly) are both brothers and assassins, boys grown to men in a savage and hostile world. They have blood on their hands: that of criminals, that of innocents...and they know no state of existence other than being gunmen. The older of the two, introspective Eli (Reilly) rides hard with his younger sibling yet dares to dream of a normal life. The younger of the two, hard-drinking Charlie (Phoenix) has taken charge with gusto as lead man on the duo's assignments. Each increasingly questions, and quibbles with, the other's methods.The Sisters brothers find themselves on a journey through the Northwest, bringing them to the mountains of Oregon, a dangerous brothel",

Assigned to infiltrate the sector to defuse the bomb, Damien must convince Leïto to join his cause. Yet everything is not quite as it seems. Who exactly works for whom? Who is really pulling the strings? Above all, who profits from the use of this bomb? ",

            "description": "From Jacques Tourneur; director of horror classics such as \"Cat People;\" \"I Walked with a Zombie\" and \"Night of the Demon;\" comes \"The Comedy of Terrors\" – a gleefully macabre tale which brings together scream legends Vincent Price; Peter Lorre; Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone! Price is Waldo Trumbull; a lazy; unscrupulous and perpetually inebriated undertaker who is running his senile father-in-law's (Karloff) mortuary business into the ground. Facing a mound of debt and a relentless landlord; Mr. Black (Rathbone); who is threatening to evict him for falling behind with the rent; Trumbull and his reluctant assistant Felix Gillie (Lorre); devise a wicked plan to make death pay...by speeding up the demise of their unsuspecting customers! A crafty and entertaining directorial effort from Tourneur; \"The Comedy of Terrors\" bears many of the hallmarks of the master filmmaker's earlier works; while adding a healthy dose of humor to the mixture.",

            "description": "With no job security and a bleak future, Paul Dynan (Kevin Zegers of TV's GOSSIP GIRL) plans the perfect crime to help his struggling family extort a fortune from three wealthy men (including Ray Liotta of GOODFELLAS, Victor Garber of TV's DECEPTION). The plan: Abduct their socialite children (including Laura Vandervoort of TV's SMALLVILLE, Dustin Milligan of TV's 90210) and collect a healthy ransom of $3 million. Over the course of one long night, Paul and his accomplices hold the rich kids hostage. Awaiting the ransom, they have little idea of the secrets that will surface when the parents are forced to choose between their children and their money. Once blood is shed and things go horribly wrong, Paul must fight to stay one step ahead of his own twisted game.",

In an effort to change the course of the war, a United States carrier group is positioned off the coast of Midway, tasked with springing a trap on the enemy. During this pivotal battle, the two-man crew of a U.S. Navy dive bomber are forced to ditch in the sea. Set adrift, the men look towards their comrades for rescue; namely, the ragtag crew of a PBY Catalina, who are sent to search for survivors. Amid the vast openness of the Pacific, with days passing and the chance of rescue fading, the men are forced to face their own mortality",
