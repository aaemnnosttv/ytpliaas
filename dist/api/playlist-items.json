On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington.

The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day...",

George has become Lennie's protector.  Although retarded, Lennie is a willing, strong worker, and between them they expect to earn enough money to buy their own small piece of land.  Lennie's strength is also his curse.  He has a childlike attachment to small animals, but often crushes them to death.  And women, to Lennie, are like soft, small and gentle animals. The tragedy that will emerge from this fact will involve an exploited and misused woman (Sherilyn Fenn).",

Holman is made a part of the landing party and assigned to escort the missionaries back to the safety of the San Pablo.

            "title": "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines",
            "description": "This extraordinary comic version of the historic 1910 London-to-Paris air race features the greatest aviators from around the world. They all come together when a stuffy, but very rich, newspaper publisher decides to sponsor an airplane race across the English Channel. Convinced it will give his newspaper worldwide publicity, the publisher offers 10,000 pounds to the winner. The escapades between the American, British, French, German, Italian and Japanese teams result in the most daring and hilarious in-flight acrobatic stunts ever caught on film. But the film's greatest triumph is the amazing re-creation of the vintage airplanes which did the actual flying.",

Amy, a gorilla who was part of a university learning experiment, is at last returning home. A professor (Dylan Walsh), electronics expert (Laura Linney), guide (Ernie Hudson), explorer (Tim Curry) and others follow the scampering ape. They know she will lead them to the place that's more than her home - it's the site of the fabled Lost City of Zinj and its diamond mines. But what they don't know can be fatal. Once they enter Zinj, they'll be the endangered species! From the best seller by Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) comes an even-packed adventure filled with state-of-the-art technology and primal fear.",

Roy waits -- and waits -- for a suitable coaching offer, but he receives only one: a hastily scribbled fax from... members of the Mount Vernon Junior High School basketball squad. Roy reluctantly accepts the \"offer,\" hoping that a few weeks at the school will prove his good intentions and restore him to his high-living ways as a celebrated college coach. But when \"old school\" meets \"middle school,\" Coach Roy doesn't know what hit him. The boys are hapless, possessing little athletic skill and virtually no grasp of the fundamentals of basketball.

The USSR and Cuba start selective bombing, then invade the US and quickly capture the central part of the country. The film takes place entirely in a small town taken by surprise by paratroopers. A band of teenagers (led by Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell) escape to the mountains and become a group of tough guerillas who launch a series of surprise attacks on the murderous and nasty Red invaders. But the teenagers start getting a bit troubled themselves. In their brutality, are they becoming just like their enemies? The band of teens fight on, becoming smaller and smaller. They help pave the way for the eventual victory of the main American Army, busy elsewhere in the Republic.",

And when her clinic - and the livelihood of her neighbors - is threatened by the brutal local \"godfather\", Max teaches the impoverished Indians the strength of their own unity.

Committed to an assignment, David asks her to meet him two weeks later in spite of the fact that she is married. And she does. Her husband, Paul Sellinger (Christopher Plummer), is a British intelligence officer in charge of a special, dangerous mission behind enemy lines. As fate would have it, Halloran is chosen to fly Sellinger on the task.

Earth has been relatively peaceful since Godzilla was successfully buried deep in ice beneath the South Pole.  Then - sometime a few years hence-several of his old nemeses return to wreak havoc on cities worldwide. A huge spaceship suddenly appears and neutralizes all the monsters in a blink.  The visitors are \"Xiliens,\" who take human form and announce they would like to negotiate a peace treaty that would replace the United Nations with a \"United Universe\".  They are indeed too good to be true, however.  It doesn't take long before their nefarious real purpose is exposed - conquering Earth.  Greatly outmatched, Earth officials decide to de-freeze Godzilla as man's only hope to vanish the invaders, as well as the monsters they control.  Only trouble is Godzilla is still mad at man for freezing him in the first place. © 2004 Toho Pictures, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.",

With record bounties on their heads, they are forced to escape through barren and harsh terrain, even if it costs them their lives. As their options dwindle, they stumble upon the lone, unassuming farmhouse of the Tildon family. Without the means to defend themselves, George, his wife Ada, and their two daughters must survive the night with the outlaws and keep their captors at bay; the delicate dance is further complicated when Henry falls for the youngest daughter, Florence, a spitfire who is struggling with frontier life. Secrets are revealed, allegiances are tested, and the line between good and evil begins to blur. As the story builds towards its inevitably brutal climax and twist ending, it becomes obvious Florence is the family's only hope for a happy ending... if there ever was one.",

            "description": "In the tradition of FIELD OF DREAMS, TOUCHBACK is a story about sports, faith, and realizing that everything you need is already in front of you. Facing foreclosure on his home, former high school football star-turned-farmer-and-family-man, Scott Murphy (Brian Presley of BORDERLAND) has found rock bottom. But, after bumping his head, he finds himself with a unique opportunity to revisit his glory days before the Ohio State championship where he permanently injured his knee in a game-winning play. Given a second shot at destiny, Scott seeks his mentor, Coach Hand (Kurt Russell of MIRACLE, DREAMER), to help him decide whether to let his fate unfold or change his future. Also starring Melanie Lynskey (TV's TWO AND A HALF MEN), Marc Blucas (TV's NECESSARY ROUGHNESS), Sarah Wright (THE HOUSE BUNNY) and Christine Lahti (TV's LAW & ORDER: SVU, CHICAGO HOPE).",

The merchant’s youngest daughter Belle (Léa Seydoux, Spectre) bravely sacrifices herself and takes her father’s place. Once at the Beast’s castle, it is not death that awaits Belle, but a strange and fantastical life unlike anything she has ever experienced…and the discovery that her mysterious host is living under a terrible enchantment. As Belle valiantly attempts to release the Beast from his curse, the two discover that a most unlikely bond blooms between them…true love.\nVisually stunning and magnificently produced, Beauty And The Beast (La Belle Et La Bête) is a rich and thoroughly modern interpretation of one of the world’s most beloved stories, artfully told by director Christophe Gans.",

            "description": "Through a series of military and political accidents, a pair of psychotic senior military officers -- U.S. Air Force Commander Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and Joint Chiefs of Staff General \"Buck\" Turgidson (George C. Scott) -- hatch an ingenious, foolproof, and irrevocable plan to unleash a wing of B-52 bombers and their nuclear payloads on strategic targets inside Russia. And when the brains behind the scheme, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a wheelchair-bound nuclear scientist with bizarre ideas about man's future, accidentally activates the bombing mission, the President of the United States (Peter Sellers) is unable to stop it. Although he knows the secret code to stop the mission, the Royal Air Force's Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) isn't much help since he's come under attack at a U.S. Air Force base by a group of U.S. paratroopers who've been accidentally activated, too. So, despite all efforts to recall him, Major T. J. \"King\" Kong (Slim Pickens) personally sees his bombing mission to its fateful conclusion, even as the Russian Ambassador (Peter Bull) is summoned to the White House in hopes of averting a crisis and preventing the activation of the \"Doomsday\" machine. But the inevitable comes to pass as the efforts of the Pentagon brass and all the politicians in Moscow and Washington cannot undo the cascading series of cataclysmic events.",

When his father James Reid (Tom Wilkinson) dies, Britt meets an impressive and resourceful company employee, Kato (Jay Chou). They realize that they have the resources to do something worthwhile with their lives and finally step out of James Reid's shadow. Kato builds the ultimate weapon, The Black Beauty, an indestructible car with every weapon imaginable and Britt decides that in order to be heroes, they will pose as villains.

He has united all the gangs under his power, and he quickly sees that the Green Hornet is a direct threat to the prosperous criminal underworld he controls.(c) 2011 Motion Picture © 2011 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

That's the premise of The Odd Couple, though there's nothing odd in the casting of two Oscar®-winning talents like Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau. The two veteran funnymen work together with the precision timing of a vaudeville team, but always with bright spontaneity. Lemmon plays fussy Felix, fastidious to a fault. He proves that cleanliness is next to insanity. Matthau is Oscar, who wreaks havoc on a tidy room with the speed and thoroughness of a tornado. An enduring and endearing picture, with the intelligence on usually misses in comedies.",

Determined to be the heroine of her own story, Jane spends her life savings on a trip to Austenland, an eccentric resort in the English countryside where guests experience complete immersion in the Regency era.  Armed with her bonnet, corset and needlepoint, Jane strives to avoid spinsterhood and meets two very different gentlemen... but has a difficult time determining where fantasy ends and real life—and maybe even love—begins.  Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde franchise), Jane Seymour (Wedding Crashers), JJ Feild (Captain America: The First Avenger) and Bret McKenzie (TV's \"The Flight of the Conchords\") also star in this charming romantic comedy based on the bestselling novel by Shannon Hale.",

Based on the best-selling book \"The Ultimate Gift\" by Jim Stovall, the story sends trust fund baby Jason Stevens on an improbable journey of discovery, having to answer the ultimate question: \"What is the relationship between wealth and happiness?\" Jason had a very simple relationship with his impossibly wealthy Grandfather, Howard \"Red\" Stevens. He hated him. No heart-to-heart talks, no warm fuzzies, just cold hard cash. So of course he figured that when Red died, the whole \"reading of the will\" thing would be another simple cash transaction, that his Grandfather's money would allow him to continue living in the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. But what Red left him was anything but simple. Red instead devised a plan for Jason to experience a crash course on life. Twelve tasks, which Red calls \"gifts,\" each challenging Jason in an improbable way, the accumulation of which would change him forever.",

            "description": "It's a comedy celebration as Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau reunite to reprise their roles as Felix and Oscar in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II. The times may have changed, but thankfully not the traits that make ex-roomies Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau) the all-time perfect mismatch. Oscar is still an uncompromising slob who thinks a brown sock and a black sock is close enough. Felix is still a fussbudget who can't pass a spice rack without arranging it alphabetically. After years of going their separate ways, the two are together again, en route to the weeding of Oscar's son to Felix's daughter. They've got the map, the rental car, a tankful of Simon's comedy zingers, and they're getting 1,000 smiles to the gallon.",

When skating legend Jimmy Wilson's skate demo tour hits town, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned skate team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Jimmy's road manager and they can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. But they do get some free advice: keep skating, stay true to yourself, and stay in the game--if you're good, you'll get noticed. Following their dream-- and Jimmy's national tour--Eric, Dustin and Matt start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund. After recruiting laid-back ladies man Sweet Lou to join their crew and provide the wheels for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chi-town to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody skaters, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acuña, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.",

Now a benevolent leader of his people, Caesar supports a peaceful coexistence with humans, much to the dismay of his militant counterpart General Aldo (Claude Akins). When Caesar learns that new evidence regarding his parents' murder has been found in the Forbidden City, he journeys to the bombarded wasteland with the human MacDonald (Austin Stoker) and the omniscient orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams). While he does find what he is looking for, Caesar also unwittingly awakens a flock of human survivors, who follows his group back home.",

She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, yet plot to kill Nicodemus during the move.",

            "description": "Behind ever great man there lies a teacher, and this was certainly true of Bruce Lee, who claimed as his mentor a martial arts expert named Ip Man (1893-1972). A genius of Wushu (or the Chinese martial arts school), Ip Man (Donnie Yen) grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung-fun warriors - ultimately training martial arts icons such as Bruce Lee. This biopic from director Wilson Yip dramatizes Ip's life story.",

On the eve of her twelfth birthday, however, she learns that she is far from ordinary. Destined to turn into a Mermaid at the age of twelve, Siren must struggle with her new reality, saying good bye to her mother and friends, while she transitions into the water. To make matters worse, a group of Hunters are after her, trying to catch her. She soon becomes friends with Adam Wilts, a new boy at school, who she turns to for help. He agrees to help her, but finds himself caught in the middle, when it's his own father who is after Siren. When Siren's mother is taken, the town must rally behind her, and help her make a peaceful transition into the water, before the hunters can find out where she is.",

            "description": "Everyone has a breaking point. Pray that Carrie White doesn't reach hers. Angela Bettis (Girl, Interrupted) stars in this bone-chilling update of Stephen King's legendary tale of horror and retribution, featuring eye-popping special effects and a shocking, all-new twist ending!  Carrie White (Bettis) is a lonely, awkward teenage girl who just doesn't fit in. At school, she endures her classmates' constant ridicule, and at home she suffers endless psychological torture at the hands of her fanatically religious mother (Patricia Clarkson, \"Six Feet Under\"). But Carrie has a secret. She's been cursed with the terrifying power of telekinesis. And when her tormentors commit an act of unforgivably cruel humiliation at the prom, they'll soon learn a deadly lesson: If you mess with fire, you will get burned!",

The only things that could make such a spectatcle more upsetting are special features, such a scommentary by me or outtakes involving nervous laughter. I am bound to continue my research into the lives of the Baudelelaire orphans, but you are free to seek lighter fare, like bleu cheese fondue. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket.",

Valdez Is Coming boldly recreates America's western frontier, a place where life was sometimes cheap... but honor was always priceless. When it comes to keeping the peace, former frontier sheriff Bob Valdez has always been the voice of reason in a sea of chaos. But Frank Tanner (Jon Cypher) is a very different sort of man: greedy, impulsive and rotten to the core. So when Tanner provokes a shootout that results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez orders him to provide financial support for the widow. But when Tanner not only refuses but also laughs in his face, Valdez dusts off his old uniform, straps on his guns and vows to exact justice and vengeance at any cost.",

            "title": "Miss Potter",
            "description": "Inspired by a true story set in Victorian England, a tale charting the life of Beatrix Potter--a literary phenomenon of the early 20th century. At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage, Beatrix became an iconic figure, swimming quietly, but with great fortitude, against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago, and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and--had she been a man--her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust, the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter's day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation.",

But when his friend, a gifted graffiti artist, is killed in a tragic accident, Kenny comes face to face with the high price of artistic passion.",

Colonel John Marlowe (John Wayne) and three regiments of the Union cavalry set out to ride into the heart of the Confederacy--a 300-mile journey.  Their objective is to sever the railroad line to Vicksburg, Mississippi, and thus force that city's surrender to the Union army.  When the mission is completed, Marlowe will have to face the task of leading his men out of the South to safety.  Based upon a historical Civil War incident.  The cast includes classic Western star Hoot Gibson, tennis champion Althea Gibson, Anna Lee, Ken Curtis, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin and Hank Worden.",

            "description": "From acclaimed director Jacques Audiard (Rust and Bone, A Prophet), and based on the novel by Patrick deWitt, THE SISTERS BROTHERS is a reimagining of the cinematic Western as a dangerous, witty, and emotionally cathartic exploration of what it means to be a man. It is 1851, and Charlie and Eli Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly) are both brothers and assassins, boys grown to men in a savage and hostile world. They have blood on their hands: that of criminals, that of innocents...and they know no state of existence other than being gunmen. The older of the two, introspective Eli (Reilly) rides hard with his younger sibling yet dares to dream of a normal life. The younger of the two, hard-drinking Charlie (Phoenix) has taken charge with gusto as lead man on the duo's assignments. Each increasingly questions, and quibbles with, the other's methods.The Sisters brothers find themselves on a journey through the Northwest, bringing them to the mountains of Oregon, a dangerous brothel",

The confusion and intensity of a single moment in war are captured in this intense and bloody WWII drama about the destruction of a single vital bridge (the Ludendorff Bridge) at Remagen.  As American forces move into Germany, the Nazi high command orders the bridge destroyed.  A German major (Robert Vaughn), realizing the destruction of the bridge will cut his troops off from their homeland, delays the carrying out of his orders.  The Americans, under officer George Segal, are ordered to capture the German troops and, if needed, blow up the bridge themselves.  A deadly clash of conscience and arms begins.",

            "description": "\"A study of crazy brilliance and flamboyant sincerity\" (Los Angeles Herald-Examiner), \"a.k.a Cassius Clay\" presents a fascinating look at the incredible life and achievements of one of the most courageous, outspoken and charismatic figures of boxing: Muhammad Ali. Born Cassius Clay in 1942, Ali soon rose to become a renowned athlete, an articulate author and a compelling political leader. Audacious, ambitious and totally fearless, Ali became a symbol of pride, a legend of hope and one of the most extraordinary icons of the 20th century. This \"provocative\" (Boxoffice) documentary charts the voyage of a man who grabbed Olympic gold at the age of 18, captured the World Heavyweight title at 21, and ultimately came to power as one of the most forceful leaders of the American civil rights movement. Features clips from his most hailed fights with Archie Moore and Sonny Liston, rare interviews with his trainer Cus D'Amato, and extraordinary footage of Ali during his alliance with Malcolm X.",

            "description": "Visually luscious and drenched with the big beats of classic cuts and freestyle rhyming by some of the masters of the music, SOMETHING FROM NOTHING: THE ART OF RAP is a performance documentary about the runaway juggernaut that is Hip-Hop.  At the wheel of this unstoppable beast is Ice-T, who takes us on a personal journey into the asphalt roots of the music that saved his life.   This film is not about stardom, bling, or beef; it's about the craft and skill - what goes on inside the minds and erupts from the lips of rap legends.  Ice-T travels from coast to coast, engaging intimately with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa, Eminem, Nas, Mos Def, Kanye West, Chuck D, KRS-One, Snoop Dogg, Run-DMC, and Ice Cube.  The film features original rapping and some classic never heard before a cappellas from the mouths of the creators.  What emerges is a mighty soul tribute to the original American art form that brought poetry to a new generation.\n MPAA Rating: R  2012 The Art of Rap Films LTD",

            "description": "On June 4th, 2004, a sixty-three-ton bulldozer, fortified with steel and concrete, systematically destroyed numerous businesses and homes in the small mountain town of Granby, Colorado. The rampage lasted over two hours and resulted in more than eight million dollars in damage. State and local police were incapable of even slowing the machine. Though it was armed with three high-powered firearms, no one but the driver was killed. His name was Marvin Heemeyer. TREAD explores the polarizing perspectives on this man, his motives, and what drove him to the breaking point.",

Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) is still haunted by her failure to save the life of a missing child from the hands of two young girls. Eight years later, another child goes missing in the same town just days after Ronnie and Alice (Dakota Fanning and newcomer Danielle Macdonald), the two girls convicted of the former crime, were released from juvenile detention. Porter and her partner (Nate Parker) must race against the clock to prevent history from repeating itself. But as they begin to investigate the girls and their families, especially Alice's protective mother (Diane Lane), they unearth a web of secrets and deceptions that calls everything into question.",

            "description": "Rarely can a film penetrate the glamorous surface of rock legends. It Might Get Loud tells the personal stories, in their own words, of three generations of electric guitar virtuosos -- The Edge (U2), Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), and Jack White (The White Stripes). It reveals how each developed his unique sound and style of playing favorite instruments, guitars both found and invented. Concentrating on the artist's musical rebellion, traveling with him to influential locations, provoking rare discussion as to how and why he writes and plays, this film lets you witness intimate moments and hear new music from each artist. The movie revolves around a day when Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge first met and sat down together to share their stories, teach and play. 2009 Steel Curtain Pictures, LLC.

The plan: Abduct their socialite children (including Laura Vandervoort of TV's SMALLVILLE, Dustin Milligan of TV's 90210) and collect a healthy ransom of $3 million. Over the course of one long night, Paul and his accomplices hold the rich kids hostage.

Once blood is shed and things go horribly wrong, Paul must fight to stay one step ahead of his own twisted game.",

Set in German East Africa just prior to World War I; \"Shout at the Devil\" is the story of Flynn O'Flynn (Marvin) and Sebastian Oldsmith (Moore); two men who have teamed up on a series of illicit poaching raids. Their actions soon catch the eye of German Commissioner Herman Fleischer; who uses his authority to enact a terrible punishment. O'Flynn and Oldsmith embark on a personal campaign against Fleischer; eventually being recruited by the allied forces to take on an even bigger target-an elusive German battleship. Also starring Ian Holm (\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\") and Barbara Parkins (\"Asylum\"); \"Shout at the Devil\" is an exciting mix of humor; action; and the unique chemistry shared between two of Hollywood's finest stars.",

Halfway up the mountain, their chair lift stops, the lights go out and the resort closes for the week. They are stranded, but the worst is still to come. A storm is approaching. Frostbite is setting in. And on the ground below them, a pack of hungry wolves has gathered to wait. Kevin Zegers (DAWN OF THE DEAD, WRONG TURN), Shawn Ashmore (X-MEN, THE RUINS) and Emma Bell star in the relentlessly chilling thriller from writer/director Adam Green (HATCHET) that Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News hails as \"a vicious, scary and horrifying experience...FROZEN is a howling good time!\"",

Gillespie's (O'Connor) term as County Sheriff is coming to an end, and his enemies have found a local businessman, Kerry Madigan (John Calvin), who has high political aspiration, to run against him. They even attempt to enlist Forbes' (Weathers) support and the support of the local press in painting an unfavorable picture of Gillespie.

But when an advanced prototype robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment) is programmed to      show unconditional love, his human family isn't prepared for the consequences. Suddenly, David      is on his own in a strange and dangerous world. Befriended by a streetwise Mecha (Jude law),      David embarks on a spectacular quest to discover the startling secret of his own identity.      Celebrated as a film \"filled with visual wonders and astonishing special effects...\" (Roger      Ebert & Roeper), A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a visionary motion picture      triumph!",

Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, a special unit highly trained in martial arts and the precise physical skills necessary to navigate the treacherous urban landscape of Paris' future. He is now tasked with the most vital and dangerous mission of his career: to retrieve a loose nuke stolen by the most powerful gang of District B13. Leïto, a vigilante criminal whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang, knows District B13 like the back of his hand. Assigned to infiltrate the sector to defuse the bomb, Damien must convince Leïto to join his cause. Yet everything is not quite as it seems. Who exactly works for whom? Who is really pulling the strings? Above all, who profits from the use of this bomb? ",

But warnings from his high-strung boss and laid-back co-worker can't prevent Henry from breaking rule number one: Never fall for the beautiful daughter (Sarah Roemer of DISTURBIA, THE GRUDGE 2) of one of the building's wealthiest tenants. In a world where rich snobs never mix with minimum-wage slobs, can a romance between a regular guy from Flatbush and a 5th-Avenue rich girl even make it past the front door? Also starring Grammy-nominated rapper Snoop Dogg, Rachael Leigh Cook (SHE'S ALL THAT), Joe Pantoliano (THE SOPRANOS, MATRIX), and Mimi Rogers (AUSTIN POWERS).",

            "description": "A teenager with a death wish and a 79-year-old high on life find love in Hal      Ashby's cult black comedy. Deadpan rich boy Harold (Bud Cort) keeps staging elaborate suicide      tableaux to get the attention of his mother (Vivian Pickles), but she keeps planning his      brilliant future for him instead. Obsessed with the trappings of death, Harold freaks out his      blind dates, modifies his new sports car to look like a mini-hearse, and attends funerals,      where he meets the spirited Maude (Ruth Gordon). An eccentric to the core, Maude lives exactly      as she pleases, with avid collecting and nude modeling among her many pursuits. To the disgust      of Harold's relatives and the befuddlement of Harold's shrink, Harold falls in love with her.      As lilting Cat Stevens tunes play on the soundtrack, Maude teaches Harold a valuable lesson      about making the most of his time on earth.",

But when this twist of fate turns out to be an act of murder, Chief of Police Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) has his work cut out for him.

To know Mona Dearly was to hate her, and the big mystery isn't who would want to see her dead...but who wouldn't. Now, Chief Rash tries to figure out who to blame but the town just wants to know who to thank. (Original Title - Drowning Mona) © 2000 Marigold Productions, LLC.  All Rights Reserved.",

All 185 cases fit a narrowly defined profile that was refined after researching thousands of missing person reports; these cases are the most difficult, defy common sense, challenge conventional wisdom and remain unexplained.",
