But little by little, through stories spun against a backdrop of the dusty Texas night, an amazing tale comes to life via Walter's vivid, colorful imaginings--a tale set in a long-ago exotic, mysterious place where men rode stallions and fought with swords; where beautiful princesses tangled with treacherous sheiks; and where the two unlikely heroes lived an adventure of which most people only dream.",

            "description": "Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale star in an explosive action-packed adventure with bone-charring special effects that will have you glued to your seat! When workers in a London tunneling project awaken an unearthly fire-breathing beast from centuries of slumber, all hell breaks loose. Twelve-year-old Quinn (Bale) sees his mother, one of the workers, die trying to escape this new terror. Twenty years later as a \"fire chief,\" he tries to keep a group of refugees alive with fierce dragons dominating the air, burning the land and feeding on the ash. Unexpectedly, Van Zan (McConaughey), a hotshot American militia leader, shows up with a ragtag group of slayers on a perilous crusade to hunt down and destroy the beasts. Tempers flare when there is a struggle for leadership -- until both men realize only one species is getting out of this alive.",

She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner (Matthew Davis) from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. Growing up across the street from Aaron Spelling might mean something in LA, but nothing to Warner's East-Coast blue blood family. So, when Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. But law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside and the mall. Elle must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes who suffer endless indignities everyday.",

After being shot at by military guards, Klaatu is brought to a Washington, D.C. hospital, where he begs a sympathetic but frank Major White (Robert Osterloh) to gather all the world's leaders so he can tell them more specifically what he has come to warn them about. Losing patience, Klaatu slips into the human world, adapting a false identity and living at a boarding house where he meets a smart woman with a conscience and her inquisitive son. Both mother and son soon find themselves embroiled in the complex mystery of Klaatu, his message and the government's witch hunt for the alien.  Seen by many as a political, religious and humanitarian effort, the film is based on Harry Bates' story, \"Farewell to the Master.\"",

            "description": "Joe Dante directed this satirical action-comedy about talking tech toys accidentally juiced-up with military microchips. After the defense industry firm Globotech takes over a small toy company, Heartland Play Systems' CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) gives the green light to develop a new line of action figures, requesting an upgrade to more realistic figures from Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and fumbling Irwin Wayfair (David Cross). Mars wants toys that act like the ones in TV commercials. The results are fierce fighting figures, the Commando Elite, programmed to seek out and destroy the kindly alien-like Gorgonites. In an effort to make the toys as natural as possible, Benson inserts Globotech's most powerful military computer chips. Meanwhile, in quiet Winslow Corners, Ohio, toy-store owner Stuart Abernathy (Kevin Dunn) and his 15-year-old son Alan (Gregory Smith) are stuck in a failing business, so when Heartland truckdriver Joe (Dick Miller) stops by with the Commando and Gorgonite toys, Alan is convinced they will be hot sellers, commenting, \"Maybe this store will finally make a little money.\" With blistering blows to their blister packs, the Commandos burst out, receive orders from their leader Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) and ready for an all-out assault on the Gorgonites. When the Gorgonite leader Archer (voice of Frank Langella) begins communicating with Alan, it causes the Commandos to perceive humans as another enemy, simply by their association with the \"Gorgonite scum,\" so an attack on the Abernathy house begins. Unfortunately, the Gorgonites can offer only limited assistance, since they have been programmed to lose. The film combines animatronics, puppetry, and computer animation. The Commando Elite voices include surviving actors from Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen (1967), while the Gorgonite voices reunited several This Is Spinal Tap (1983) cast members. A dedication to Phil Hartman (the voice of Phil Fimple) after the closing credits features a brief Hartman outtake.",

            "description": "Acclaimed as \"the funniest man in America,\"* Chris Rock delivers a first-rate performance in this romantic comedy about a man who gets a second chance at life and love. Struggling black comic Lance Barton (Rock) knows what it's like to die on stage. But when his life takes an unexpected turn - straight to heaven - Lance is sure there's been a mistake. Miraculously, he's right! An angel tells Lance he was taken prematurely but assures him he can be returned to Earth - in the aged body of a ruthless white billionaire. In this improbable reincarnation, Lance begins a hilarious quest to realize his showbiz dream...and, along the way, discovers the person he never imagined he could be. Co-starring Regina King and based on the hit film Heaven Can Wait, Down To Earth is a \"bold and brilliant comedy.\"** *Shawn Edwards, FOX-TV **Kimberly C. Roberts, THE PHILADELPHIA TRIBUNE",

As the summer before their 16th birthdays approaches, these four best friends with diverse family backgrounds and personalities hatch a plan to stay connected despite being separated for the entire season. The girls pass around a pair of secondhand jeans that, magically, look wonderful on all of them despite their different sizes, with each teen keeping the pants for two weeks. Over the summer, the pants come to represent the girls' mutual support of one another. But the jeans also lead each teenager into bruising yet ultimately healing confrontations with love and courage, death and forgiveness, in the days of The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants.",

Academy Award® winner Clint Eastwood (including 1993; Best Director – \"Unforgiven\" and 2005; Best Director; \"Million Dollar Baby\") continues his trademark role as the legendary \"Man with No Name\" in this second installment of the famous Sergio Leone trilogy. Scripted by Luciano Vincenzoni and featuring Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score; \"For a Few Dollars More\" is a modern classic – one of the greatest westerns ever made. Eastwood is a keen-eyed; quick-witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio; the territory's most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival; Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef; \"High Noon\"); is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive! Failing to capture their prey – or eliminate each other – the two are left with only one option: team up; or face certain death at the hands of Indio and his band of murderous outlaws!",

George has become Lennie's protector.  Although retarded, Lennie is a willing, strong worker, and between them they expect to earn enough money to buy their own small piece of land.  Lennie's strength is also his curse.  He has a childlike attachment to small animals, but often crushes them to death.  And women, to Lennie, are like soft, small and gentle animals. The tragedy that will emerge from this fact will involve an exploited and misused woman (Sherilyn Fenn).",

            "description": "In 1947, most of the world had left the infant nation of Israel alone in a desert ringed with fixed bayonets. Otto Preminger's epic motion picture dramatically chronicles Israel's struggle for liberation during this troubled time... As these events and struggles occur, there is a migration of European Jews (the ragged survivors of Hitler's death camps) to the New Land--aboard the refugee ship Exodus, which has been barricaded in a Cyprus harbor by British warships. After a hunger strike by its 611 passengers, the British authorities relent and allow the vessel to sail to Palestine. The second section of the film deals with the struggle of the Jews in Palestine to gain partition, and the final segment the struggle of the main characters in post-partition Palestine to help Israel stay alive as a nation.",

The true identity of the secret informant remained a mystery and source of much speculation for over 30 years. Until, in 2005, special agent Mark Felt shockingly revealed himself as the tipster. This powerful true story chronicles the life of the brilliant and uncompromising Felt, who sacrificed everything – his family, his career, his freedom – in the name of justice.",

            "description": "Vanessa Hudgens and Alex Pettyfer star in this modern day take on a classic fable in which a spoiled and shallow high school student, empowered by his own physical appearance, messes with the wrong classmate. He soon finds himself transformed into someone as unattractive on the outside as he is on the inside. Now, he has one year to find someone who can see past the surface and love him, or he will remain \"beastly\" forever. His only hope could be an unassuming classmate he never noticed before, to prove that love is never ugly.",

This spectacular conflict gave the Grecians enough time to organize a force to ultimately repel the Persians, and thus change the course of Western civilization. The film was directed by Rudolph Mate and stars Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson.",

            "description": "From the director of Arlington Road comes a spine-tingling, super-natural thriller based on actual events that will rattle your nerves and shake your beliefs. Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being can predict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted? His life, and potentially others' lives, depend on his making the right choice before time runs out. (Original TItle - The Mothman Prophecies) © 2002 Lakeshore Entertainment Corp.

The Pentagon's best minds cannot shut down or reprogram the supercomputer that is readying a missile attack against the USSR, and thereby unleash Armageddon.  The teen and his girlfriend attempt to aid the helpless Pentagon and, in a frantic race against a ticking \"doomsday clock,\" try to persuade the computer to end the \"game.\"",

Facing foreclosure on his home, former high school football star-turned-farmer-and-family-man, Scott Murphy (Brian Presley of BORDERLAND) has found rock bottom. But, after bumping his head, he finds himself with a unique opportunity to revisit his glory days before the Ohio State championship where he permanently injured his knee in a game-winning play. Given a second shot at destiny, Scott seeks his mentor, Coach Hand (Kurt Russell of MIRACLE, DREAMER), to help him decide whether to let his fate unfold or change his future. Also starring Melanie Lynskey (TV's TWO AND A HALF MEN), Marc Blucas (TV's NECESSARY ROUGHNESS), Sarah Wright (THE HOUSE BUNNY) and Christine Lahti (TV's LAW & ORDER: SVU, CHICAGO HOPE).",

            "description": "Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow, John Tucker Must Die) watched in horror as an obsessed predator (Johnathon Schaech, That Thing You Do!) murdered her family. Tonight is her senior prom and although she's anxious about the past, she's excited to celebrate her future with her friends. What Donna doesn't know is that the deranged psychopath has escaped from the asylum. He's returned to hunt her down, intent on killing anyone who gets in his way. As the night races towards its heart-pounding conclusion, the question becomes not who will be prom queen, but who will survive the killer's rampage. © 2008 Screen Gems, Inc. and Miramax Film Corp.

This movie is extremely alarming, an expression which here means \"a thrilling misadventure involving three ingenious orphans and a villionous actor named Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who wants their enormous fortune.\" It includes a suspicious fire, delicious pasta, Jim Carrey, poorly behaved looches, Billy Connolly, an incredibly deadly viper, Meryl Streep, and the voice of an imposter named Jude Law. The only things that could make such a spectatcle more upsetting are special features, such a scommentary by me or outtakes involving nervous laughter. I am bound to continue my research into the lives of the Baudelelaire orphans, but you are free to seek lighter fare, like bleu cheese fondue. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket.",

            "description": "Even though they just made off with a big score, Henry and his gang have never been more down on their luck. With record bounties on their heads, they are forced to escape through barren and harsh terrain, even if it costs them their lives. As their options dwindle, they stumble upon the lone, unassuming farmhouse of the Tildon family. Without the means to defend themselves, George, his wife Ada, and their two daughters must survive the night with the outlaws and keep their captors at bay; the delicate dance is further complicated when Henry falls for the youngest daughter, Florence, a spitfire who is struggling with frontier life. Secrets are revealed, allegiances are tested, and the line between good and evil begins to blur. As the story builds towards its inevitably brutal climax and twist ending, it becomes obvious Florence is the family's only hope for a happy ending... if there ever was one.",

Lancaster seeks the aid of local sheriff Robert Ryan, but Ryan and the local citizens try to divert Lancaster from his task because the killing was clearly an accident and because they are under the powerful sway of the boss of the hired hands, Lee J. Cobb. Lancaster tries to cut a deal with Cobb, but Cobb's hired hands, believing that it is impossible to reason with the fanatical Lancaster, goad him into a gunfight in which Lancaster kills the ranch foreman.  Lancaster will pursue the fleeing felons to an absolute point of no return in which only blood and death can be the victors. Robert Duvall/Sheree North/Richard Jordan/John Hillerman co-star.",

Valdez Is Coming boldly recreates America's western frontier, a place where life was sometimes cheap... but honor was always priceless. When it comes to keeping the peace, former frontier sheriff Bob Valdez has always been the voice of reason in a sea of chaos. But Frank Tanner (Jon Cypher) is a very different sort of man: greedy, impulsive and rotten to the core. So when Tanner provokes a shootout that results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez orders him to provide financial support for the widow. But when Tanner not only refuses but also laughs in his face, Valdez dusts off his old uniform, straps on his guns and vows to exact justice and vengeance at any cost.",

Based on the best-selling book \"The Ultimate Gift\" by Jim Stovall, the story sends trust fund baby Jason Stevens on an improbable journey of discovery, having to answer the ultimate question: \"What is the relationship between wealth and happiness?\" Jason had a very simple relationship with his impossibly wealthy Grandfather, Howard \"Red\" Stevens. He hated him. No heart-to-heart talks, no warm fuzzies, just cold hard cash. So of course he figured that when Red died, the whole \"reading of the will\" thing would be another simple cash transaction, that his Grandfather's money would allow him to continue living in the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. But what Red left him was anything but simple. Red instead devised a plan for Jason to experience a crash course on life. Twelve tasks, which Red calls \"gifts,\" each challenging Jason in an improbable way, the accumulation of which would change him forever.",

Watched over by sinister headmistress Ms. Traverse (Patricia Clarkson) and her staff, Heather is tormented by her classmates and is desperate to go home. But when students start disappearing and she begins to have horrifying visions, Heather realizes things at the school are not what they seem. She only knows there's something out there in the woods- and it won't be letting her leave any time soon.",

He's an ambitious, charismatic medical student who persuades classmates Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon to take part in a reckless experiment. To see if there is life after death, they will kill themselves: temporarily shut down (\"flatline\") their heartland brain functions to briefly experience clinical death. After Sutherland survives the first experiment, the others flatline for increasingly longer intervals. But their horror begins when they realize that although they've come back alive... they haven't come back alone. FLATLINERS is a chilling suspense thriller of obsession, fear and redemption that will take you across the line to a place where terror lives forever.",

Most of the picture is concert footage of The Band and their guest performers -- highlighted by interviews with members of the group, who eloquently articulate their personal involvement in the history of rock and roll.",

Price is Waldo Trumbull; a lazy; unscrupulous and perpetually inebriated undertaker who is running his senile father-in-law's (Karloff) mortuary business into the ground. Facing a mound of debt and a relentless landlord; Mr. Black (Rathbone); who is threatening to evict him for falling behind with the rent; Trumbull and his reluctant assistant Felix Gillie (Lorre); devise a wicked plan to make death pay...by speeding up the demise of their unsuspecting customers! A crafty and entertaining directorial effort from Tourneur; \"The Comedy of Terrors\" bears many of the hallmarks of the master filmmaker's earlier works; while adding a healthy dose of humor to the mixture.",

            "description": "Critics have called it \"OPEN WATER on a ski lift\" and \"JAWS in the snow.\" It remains perhaps the most intense and terrifying film of the year: As Sunday evening falls, three snowboarding friends decide to take one last run down the slope. Halfway up the mountain, their chair lift stops, the lights go out and the resort closes for the week. They are stranded, but the worst is still to come. A storm is approaching. Frostbite is setting in. And on the ground below them, a pack of hungry wolves has gathered to wait. Kevin Zegers (DAWN OF THE DEAD, WRONG TURN), Shawn Ashmore (X-MEN, THE RUINS) and Emma Bell star in the relentlessly chilling thriller from writer/director Adam Green (HATCHET) that Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News hails as \"a vicious, scary and horrifying experience...FROZEN is a howling good time!\"",

            "description": "Mrs. Brisby, a widowed mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbon farm. She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, yet plot to kill Nicodemus during the move.",

A genius of Wushu (or the Chinese martial arts school), Ip Man (Donnie Yen) grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung-fun warriors - ultimately training martial arts icons such as Bruce Lee. This biopic from director Wilson Yip dramatizes Ip's life story.",

But getting Lumpy's body back to Minneapolis is just the start of their adventure, as the well-intended sacrifice surprises at every turn. And when the newlyweds' path leads them to a fifteen-year-old girl in a small, northern Minnesota town, all bets are off on who Lumpy really was.",

Amidst gala coronations, football, fraternities, parades and parties, the stars of the film-Laurence Fishburne (\"Dap\" Dunlap), an intense student who encourages his buddies (\"DaFellas\") to fight for his beliefs; Giancarlo Esposito (Julian \"Big Brother Almighty\" Eaves), out to strengthen the Greek system with his Gamma PhiGamma fraternity brothers; Spike Lee (\"Half-Pint\"), driven to become a \"Gamma man\"; and Tisha Campbell (Jane Toussaint), leader of the sorority, \"Gamma Rays,\" find themselves caught up in romance and relationships/rituals and rivalries during one outrageous homecoming weekend.  With dynamic music, including EU's hit \"Da Butt\", and dance numbers choreographed by Otis Sallid (Fame), Lee successfully challenges viewpoints about self-identity and self-esteem in this original, contemporary musical comedy.",

            "description": "Tyler Doherty is an extraordinary eight-year-old boy armed with strong faith and courage as he faces his daily battle against cancer.  Surrounded by a loving family and community, Tyler's prayers take the form of letters he sends to his ultimate pen pal, God, on a daily basis.  These letters find their way into the hands of Tyler's postman, Brady, who is at a crossroads in his life, searching of Tyler's shining spirit, bravery and grace.  Inspired by a true story, Letters to God delivers a message of home, faith and courage that others can apply to their own personal struggle regardless of what they may face in their everyday lives.

In a panic, they send her to True Directions, a \"rehabilitation\" camp run by the strict and prudish Mary (Cathy Moriarty), to mount an intervention led by counselor Mike (RuPaul Charles). Megan dutifully follows the program - until she develops feelings for another camper in this timeless, satirical romantic-comedy about self-acceptance and love, costarring Michelle Williams, Clea DuVall, and Julie Delpy.",

On the eve of her twelfth birthday, however, she learns that she is far from ordinary. Destined to turn into a Mermaid at the age of twelve, Siren must struggle with her new reality, saying good bye to her mother and friends, while she transitions into the water. To make matters worse, a group of Hunters are after her, trying to catch her. She soon becomes friends with Adam Wilts, a new boy at school, who she turns to for help. He agrees to help her, but finds himself caught in the middle, when it's his own father who is after Siren. When Siren's mother is taken, the town must rally behind her, and help her make a peaceful transition into the water, before the hunters can find out where she is.",

When skating legend Jimmy Wilson's skate demo tour hits town, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned skate team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Jimmy's road manager and they can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. But they do get some free advice: keep skating, stay true to yourself, and stay in the game--if you're good, you'll get noticed. Following their dream-- and Jimmy's national tour--Eric, Dustin and Matt start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund. After recruiting laid-back ladies man Sweet Lou to join their crew and provide the wheels for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chi-town to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody skaters, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acuña, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.",

Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) is still haunted by her failure to save the life of a missing child from the hands of two young girls. Eight years later, another child goes missing in the same town just days after Ronnie and Alice (Dakota Fanning and newcomer Danielle Macdonald), the two girls convicted of the former crime, were released from juvenile detention. Porter and her partner (Nate Parker) must race against the clock to prevent history from repeating itself. But as they begin to investigate the girls and their families, especially Alice's protective mother (Diane Lane), they unearth a web of secrets and deceptions that calls everything into question.",

With government agents and gangsters closing in on the operation, it seems the county may run dry-but the untamed Doolin is a man who plays by his own rules, and slams the pedal to the metal for one last run. Gene Barry (\"Hong Kong Confidential\") and Keely Smith (\"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\") also star in this 100 proof, full-force cyclone of action and drama.",

Former police detective David Paulides was initially brought on to investigate the circumstances around the many mysterious disappearances - here he presents the haunting true stories of hunters experiencing the unexplainable. Missing 411: The Hunted is based on the book by Paulides, which documents 185 cases of missing peoples from four different countries. All 185 cases fit a narrowly defined profile that was refined after researching thousands of missing person reports; these cases are the most difficult, defy common sense, challenge conventional wisdom and remain unexplained.",

            "description": "Inspired by a true story set in Victorian England, a tale charting the life of Beatrix Potter--a literary phenomenon of the early 20th century. At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage, Beatrix became an iconic figure, swimming quietly, but with great fortitude, against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago, and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and--had she been a man--her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust, the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter's day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation.",

She is too busy juggling work, bills, and the very married Dr. Hartford (Matthew Modine), to give her daughter, Ansiedad (Cierra Ramirez) the attention she desperately needs. When Ansiedad's English teacher, Ms. Armstrong (Patricia Arquette), introduces her students to classic coming-of-age stories, Ansiedad is inspired to skip adolescence and jump-start her life without mom. While Grace becomes preoccupied with the increasing affections of her co-worker (Eugenio Derbez), Ansiedad enlists the help of her loyal friend, Tavita (Raini Rodriguez), to plot her shortcut to \"adulthood\". But as her misguided plan unravels, Ansiedad and Grace must learn that sometimes growing-up means acting your age.",

Everything changes when she receives a life insurance check accidentally made out for $5,000,000 instead of the expected $50,000. At the not-so-gentle urging her best friend Maddie (Jessica Lange), Eva deposits the money and the two friends head to the Canary Islands with every intention of living it up.

            "description": "This film takes place where the skateboarding culture is most foreign, the Midwest.  Like all skaters, Derrick Cabrera dreams of being sponsored and one day going pro.  He is an up-and-coming skater with all the talent, but he has the world against him.  His parents and classmates cannot understand how Derrick has so much passion for something that has no future in their eyes.  He is only accepted in his skater crew of friends, but as he gets better and better, some of those friends become his biggest rivals.  After getting arrested and facing ultimatums with his father and girlfriend, he runs away with his skateboarding crew to Florida for a big skateboarding contest that will change his life.  A street skateboarder's constant battles are showcased through Derrick Cabrera's character and the film's amusing yet serious plotline.",

Ruby’s world is classical and disciplined; Johnnie’s is improvisational and street smart. When a hip-hop battle gone wrong throws these two artists together, they immediately clash but can’t deny it when sparks begin to fly. Their lives quickly get entangled in the pitfalls that come with competing in New York City. With the help of a dynamic dance crew called The SwitchSteps, Ruby and Johnnie must find a way to save Ruby’s scholarship and keep Johnnie from being deported. \n  \nIn an action-packed extravaganza combining cutting edge hip-hop with contemporary and classical dance, the two must navigate their opposing worlds and prepare for a competition where winning or losing will change their lives forever.",

            "description": "From acclaimed director Jacques Audiard (Rust and Bone, A Prophet), and based on the novel by Patrick deWitt, THE SISTERS BROTHERS is a reimagining of the cinematic Western as a dangerous, witty, and emotionally cathartic exploration of what it means to be a man. It is 1851, and Charlie and Eli Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly) are both brothers and assassins, boys grown to men in a savage and hostile world. They have blood on their hands: that of criminals, that of innocents...and they know no state of existence other than being gunmen. The older of the two, introspective Eli (Reilly) rides hard with his younger sibling yet dares to dream of a normal life. The younger of the two, hard-drinking Charlie (Phoenix) has taken charge with gusto as lead man on the duo's assignments. Each increasingly questions, and quibbles with, the other's methods.The Sisters brothers find themselves on a journey through the Northwest, bringing them to the mountains of Oregon, a dangerous brothel",

Heather is convinced that the edgy filmmaker and bubbly pink-wearing bride have nothing in common, but as the big day approaches she finds that no one is quite what they seem – especially the old friend she thought she knew better than anyone.",

The plan: Abduct their socialite children (including Laura Vandervoort of TV's SMALLVILLE, Dustin Milligan of TV's 90210) and collect a healthy ransom of $3 million. Over the course of one long night, Paul and his accomplices hold the rich kids hostage.

Once blood is shed and things go horribly wrong, Paul must fight to stay one step ahead of his own twisted game.",

Experience Blake Baggett’s newly-developed El Chupacabra Ranch in Florida, one of the most gargantuan home tracks ever made, where Baggett and Ken Roczen enjoy a daily routine of riding light speed fast laps with an almost lackadaisical ease. Three miles away, Aldon Baker trains factory superstars Ryan Dungey, Marvin Musqin and Jason Anderson on a program fit for Seal Team Six. Then there’s the Smokey Mountains in Idaho, where the Sipes brothers Ryan and Justin go to feel the sweet serenity of a man, his motorcycle, and countless miles of natural single-track. All of these riders are taking moto to territories it has never seen, be that on the stopwatch or the trail map. There’s Colton Haaker, the Endurocross phenom whose bike-control and technical abilities are that of superhuman levels. Then of course, Justin Barcia, the exemplar of style on a motocross bike, the guy who defies logic and rides with an amount of panache and flamboyance that is shunned in professional motocross, yet somehow has climbed to the top of the sport.",
