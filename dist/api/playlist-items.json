            "description": "Gina Norris is a long way from the Barbershop - she's moved from Chicago to Atlanta so her daughter can attend a prestigious music school, and she's made a name for herself at a posh salon with her cutting-edge hairstyles.  But when her egotistical boss takes credit for her work, she leaves the salon with the shampoo girl in tow to open a shop of her own.  Gina buys a rundown salon and inherits a motley group of headstrong stylists, a colorful clientele, and a sexy piano-playing electrician.  It's a rocky road to fulfilling her dreams, but you can't keep a good woman down.",

On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species.

On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day...",

But when an advanced prototype robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment) is programmed to      show unconditional love, his human family isn't prepared for the consequences. Suddenly, David      is on his own in a strange and dangerous world. Befriended by a streetwise Mecha (Jude law),      David embarks on a spectacular quest to discover the startling secret of his own identity.      Celebrated as a film \"filled with visual wonders and astonishing special effects...\" (Roger      Ebert & Roeper), A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a visionary motion picture      triumph!",

The USSR and Cuba start selective bombing, then invade the US and quickly capture the central part of the country. The film takes place entirely in a small town taken by surprise by paratroopers. A band of teenagers (led by Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell) escape to the mountains and become a group of tough guerillas who launch a series of surprise attacks on the murderous and nasty Red invaders. But the teenagers start getting a bit troubled themselves. In their brutality, are they becoming just like their enemies? The band of teens fight on, becoming smaller and smaller. They help pave the way for the eventual victory of the main American Army, busy elsewhere in the Republic.",

            "description": "Britt Reid (Seth Rogen), son and heir to Los Angeles' largest newspaper fortune, is a rich, spoiled playboy who has been happy to maintain a direction-less existence. When his father James Reid (Tom Wilkinson) dies, Britt meets an impressive and resourceful company employee, Kato (Jay Chou). They realize that they have the resources to do something worthwhile with their lives and finally step out of James Reid's shadow. Kato builds the ultimate weapon, The Black Beauty, an indestructible car with every weapon imaginable and Britt decides that in order to be heroes, they will pose as villains. With the help of Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), they learn that the chief criminal in the city is named Benjamin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). He has united all the gangs under his power, and he quickly sees that the Green Hornet is a direct threat to the prosperous criminal underworld he controls.(c) 2011 Motion Picture © 2011 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

            "description": "John Steinbeck's classic 1937 novel is given new life by director Gary Sinise who also plays the part of George Milton, a laborer who has thrown in his lot with a hulking giant, Lennie Small (John Malkovich), whose brain failed to develop with his body.  George has become Lennie's protector.  Although retarded, Lennie is a willing, strong worker, and between them they expect to earn enough money to buy their own small piece of land.  Lennie's strength is also his curse.  He has a childlike attachment to small animals, but often crushes them to death.  And women, to Lennie, are like soft, small and gentle animals. The tragedy that will emerge from this fact will involve an exploited and misused woman (Sherilyn Fenn).",

With record bounties on their heads, they are forced to escape through barren and harsh terrain, even if it costs them their lives. As their options dwindle, they stumble upon the lone, unassuming farmhouse of the Tildon family. Without the means to defend themselves, George, his wife Ada, and their two daughters must survive the night with the outlaws and keep their captors at bay; the delicate dance is further complicated when Henry falls for the youngest daughter, Florence, a spitfire who is struggling with frontier life. Secrets are revealed, allegiances are tested, and the line between good and evil begins to blur. As the story builds towards its inevitably brutal climax and twist ending, it becomes obvious Florence is the family's only hope for a happy ending... if there ever was one.",

That's the premise of The Odd Couple, though there's nothing odd in the casting of two Oscar®-winning talents like Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau. The two veteran funnymen work together with the precision timing of a vaudeville team, but always with bright spontaneity. Lemmon plays fussy Felix, fastidious to a fault. He proves that cleanliness is next to insanity. Matthau is Oscar, who wreaks havoc on a tidy room with the speed and thoroughness of a tornado. An enduring and endearing picture, with the intelligence on usually misses in comedies.",

This movie is extremely alarming, an expression which here means \"a thrilling misadventure involving three ingenious orphans and a villionous actor named Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who wants their enormous fortune.\" It includes a suspicious fire, delicious pasta, Jim Carrey, poorly behaved looches, Billy Connolly, an incredibly deadly viper, Meryl Streep, and the voice of an imposter named Jude Law. The only things that could make such a spectatcle more upsetting are special features, such a scommentary by me or outtakes involving nervous laughter. I am bound to continue my research into the lives of the Baudelelaire orphans, but you are free to seek lighter fare, like bleu cheese fondue. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket.",

Roy waits -- and waits -- for a suitable coaching offer, but he receives only one: a hastily scribbled fax from... members of the Mount Vernon Junior High School basketball squad. Roy reluctantly accepts the \"offer,\" hoping that a few weeks at the school will prove his good intentions and restore him to his high-living ways as a celebrated college coach. But when \"old school\" meets \"middle school,\" Coach Roy doesn't know what hit him. The boys are hapless, possessing little athletic skill and virtually no grasp of the fundamentals of basketball.

The times may have changed, but thankfully not the traits that make ex-roomies Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau) the all-time perfect mismatch. Oscar is still an uncompromising slob who thinks a brown sock and a black sock is close enough. Felix is still a fussbudget who can't pass a spice rack without arranging it alphabetically. After years of going their separate ways, the two are together again, en route to the weeding of Oscar's son to Felix's daughter. They've got the map, the rental car, a tankful of Simon's comedy zingers, and they're getting 1,000 smiles to the gallon.",

            "description": "Through a series of military and political accidents, a pair of psychotic senior military officers -- U.S. Air Force Commander Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and Joint Chiefs of Staff General \"Buck\" Turgidson (George C. Scott) -- hatch an ingenious, foolproof, and irrevocable plan to unleash a wing of B-52 bombers and their nuclear payloads on strategic targets inside Russia. And when the brains behind the scheme, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a wheelchair-bound nuclear scientist with bizarre ideas about man's future, accidentally activates the bombing mission, the President of the United States (Peter Sellers) is unable to stop it. Although he knows the secret code to stop the mission, the Royal Air Force's Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) isn't much help since he's come under attack at a U.S. Air Force base by a group of U.S. paratroopers who've been accidentally activated, too. So, despite all efforts to recall him, Major T. J. \"King\" Kong (Slim Pickens) personally sees his bombing mission to its fateful conclusion, even as the Russian Ambassador (Peter Bull) is summoned to the White House in hopes of averting a crisis and preventing the activation of the \"Doomsday\" machine. But the inevitable comes to pass as the efforts of the Pentagon brass and all the politicians in Moscow and Washington cannot undo the cascading series of cataclysmic events.",

Earth has been relatively peaceful since Godzilla was successfully buried deep in ice beneath the South Pole.  Then - sometime a few years hence-several of his old nemeses return to wreak havoc on cities worldwide. A huge spaceship suddenly appears and neutralizes all the monsters in a blink.  The visitors are \"Xiliens,\" who take human form and announce they would like to negotiate a peace treaty that would replace the United Nations with a \"United Universe\".  They are indeed too good to be true, however.  It doesn't take long before their nefarious real purpose is exposed - conquering Earth.  Greatly outmatched, Earth officials decide to de-freeze Godzilla as man's only hope to vanish the invaders, as well as the monsters they control.  Only trouble is Godzilla is still mad at man for freezing him in the first place. © 2004 Toho Pictures, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.",

They all come together when a stuffy, but very rich, newspaper publisher decides to sponsor an airplane race across the English Channel. Convinced it will give his newspaper worldwide publicity, the publisher offers 10,000 pounds to the winner.

But the film's greatest triumph is the amazing re-creation of the vintage airplanes which did the actual flying.",

Since then, humans nearly rendered themselves extinct in an all-out nuclear war, and the survivors are now beneath the well-preserved ape society. Now a benevolent leader of his people, Caesar supports a peaceful coexistence with humans, much to the dismay of his militant counterpart General Aldo (Claude Akins). When Caesar learns that new evidence regarding his parents' murder has been found in the Forbidden City, he journeys to the bombarded wasteland with the human MacDonald (Austin Stoker) and the omniscient orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams). While he does find what he is looking for, Caesar also unwittingly awakens a flock of human survivors, who follows his group back home.",

The merchant’s youngest daughter Belle (Léa Seydoux, Spectre) bravely sacrifices herself and takes her father’s place. Once at the Beast’s castle, it is not death that awaits Belle, but a strange and fantastical life unlike anything she has ever experienced…and the discovery that her mysterious host is living under a terrible enchantment. As Belle valiantly attempts to release the Beast from his curse, the two discover that a most unlikely bond blooms between them…true love.\nVisually stunning and magnificently produced, Beauty And The Beast (La Belle Et La Bête) is a rich and thoroughly modern interpretation of one of the world’s most beloved stories, artfully told by director Christophe Gans.",

With so much at stake, Jerry enlists the help of his kung fu master to train him for the ultimate fight, only to go head-to-head with a rival mobster boss hell-bent on snatching the Brawl's champion trophy.",

Certain children are born geniuses, prodigies born with the wisdom of the ages, who around the age of two lose their extraordinary intelligence as they begin to communicate with adults. Though her discoveries could earn her a Nobel Prize, Dr. Kinder and her esteemed associate Heep (Christopher Lloyd) have another goal in mind: to tap into the infant and toddler brain power source and use the resulting intellectual energy to secure their own personal power and wealth.

When Ansiedad's English teacher, Ms. Armstrong (Patricia Arquette), introduces her students to classic coming-of-age stories, Ansiedad is inspired to skip adolescence and jump-start her life without mom. While Grace becomes preoccupied with the increasing affections of her co-worker (Eugenio Derbez), Ansiedad enlists the help of her loyal friend, Tavita (Raini Rodriguez), to plot her shortcut to \"adulthood\". But as her misguided plan unravels, Ansiedad and Grace must learn that sometimes growing-up means acting your age.",

Line is her team's captain, helping coach Kathy Coach Brez\" Bresnahan (Oscar winner Helen Hunt) rally everyone together to repeat their championship win from 2010. Then, in August 2011, as her senior year is about to begin, Line is in an accident that leaves her team, her school, and her father, Ernie (Oscar winner William Hurt), heartbroken by their loss. But when the team starts to wonder if they can move forward, Ernie's strength and faith spur them on, and Caroline's best friend encourages her classmates, Coach Brez, and even the opponents the City West team faces across the net to \"Live Like Line\" – to never back down, never stop smiling, and always give 100 percent, even when the odds seem impossible.",

Stallone co-wrote the screenplay.",

Determined to be the heroine of her own story, Jane spends her life savings on a trip to Austenland, an eccentric resort in the English countryside where guests experience complete immersion in the Regency era.  Armed with her bonnet, corset and needlepoint, Jane strives to avoid spinsterhood and meets two very different gentlemen... but has a difficult time determining where fantasy ends and real life—and maybe even love—begins.  Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde franchise), Jane Seymour (Wedding Crashers), JJ Feild (Captain America: The First Avenger) and Bret McKenzie (TV's \"The Flight of the Conchords\") also star in this charming romantic comedy based on the bestselling novel by Shannon Hale.",

Lara, a perpetually indignant, arrogantly feministic lady, initially hates the methodical and rules-following Killion, and so she does all she can to avoid him and disregard his safety procedures.

Wayne's partner in criminal hunting is a British inspector (Richard Attenborough) with a very different personal style.  After a rough bit, they become partners and cooperate in a rousing batch of car chases, false and good leads, booby traps, etc., before they trap their man.  Detective Wayne finds time for some heavy flirting with Constable Judy Geeson (TO SIR, WITH LOVE), who would prefer that Wayne's flirting was considerably less heavy.

            "description": "New Yorker Harvey Shine (Academy-Award®-winner Dustin Hoffman) is on the verge of losing his dead-end job as a jingle writer. Warned by his boss (Richard Schiff) that he has just one more chance to deliver, Harvey goes to London for a weekend wedding for his daughter but promises to be back on Monday. When he misses the plane and is fired on the spot, Harvey strikes up a conversation with Kate (Academy-Award®-winner Emma Thompson), a slightly prickly, 40-something employee of the Office of National Statistics. Thus, through the devastation of Harvey's life, a new romance is born.",

            "description": "While the rest of his high school graduating class is heading to the same old grind of college, skateboarder Eric Rivers and his best friends, Dustin, a goal-oriented workaholic, and misfit slacker Matt have one last summer roadtrip together to follow their dream of getting noticed by the professional skateboarding world--and getting paid to skate. When skating legend Jimmy Wilson's skate demo tour hits town, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned skate team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Jimmy's road manager and they can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. But they do get some free advice: keep skating, stay true to yourself, and stay in the game--if you're good, you'll get noticed. Following their dream-- and Jimmy's national tour--Eric, Dustin and Matt start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund. After recruiting laid-back ladies man Sweet Lou to join their crew and provide the wheels for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chi-town to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody skaters, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acuña, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.",

He hated him. No heart-to-heart talks, no warm fuzzies, just cold hard cash. So of course he figured that when Red died, the whole \"reading of the will\" thing would be another simple cash transaction, that his Grandfather's money would allow him to continue living in the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. But what Red left him was anything but simple. Red instead devised a plan for Jason to experience a crash course on life. Twelve tasks, which Red calls \"gifts,\" each challenging Jason in an improbable way, the accumulation of which would change him forever.",

A genius of Wushu (or the Chinese martial arts school), Ip Man (Donnie Yen) grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung-fun warriors - ultimately training martial arts icons such as Bruce Lee. This biopic from director Wilson Yip dramatizes Ip's life story.",

Garner is actually delighted with the mistake and decides to take the town for everything he can get!  Also on hand is Garner's sidekick, dim-witted Jack Elam, and a love interest, tomboyish Suzanne Pleshette, whose ambition is to start a ladies finishing school.  But when genuine-gunslinger Connors arrives in town and challenges Garner, Garner remarks, 'I'm slow...but you're slower.'  We will never know...Connors shoots himself in the foot.

Twenty years later, the inconceivable happened...the message was answered.  Someone--or something--knows where to find us...  The reply contained a DNA sequence and the friendly instructions to combine it with our own. It was, perhaps, the inviolable dominance we have enjoyed for time immemorial that allowed our curiosity to overcome our fear.  We believed we were in control; we presumed we could handle the result; we assumed we would always be dominant.  We were wrong...",

It is 1851, and Charlie and Eli Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly) are both brothers and assassins, boys grown to men in a savage and hostile world. They have blood on their hands: that of criminals, that of innocents...and they know no state of existence other than being gunmen. The older of the two, introspective Eli (Reilly) rides hard with his younger sibling yet dares to dream of a normal life. The younger of the two, hard-drinking Charlie (Phoenix) has taken charge with gusto as lead man on the duo's assignments. Each increasingly questions, and quibbles with, the other's methods.The Sisters brothers find themselves on a journey through the Northwest, bringing them to the mountains of Oregon, a dangerous brothel",

On the eve of her twelfth birthday, however, she learns that she is far from ordinary. Destined to turn into a Mermaid at the age of twelve, Siren must struggle with her new reality, saying good bye to her mother and friends, while she transitions into the water. To make matters worse, a group of Hunters are after her, trying to catch her. She soon becomes friends with Adam Wilts, a new boy at school, who she turns to for help. He agrees to help her, but finds himself caught in the middle, when it's his own father who is after Siren. When Siren's mother is taken, the town must rally behind her, and help her make a peaceful transition into the water, before the hunters can find out where she is.",

Valdez Is Coming boldly recreates America's western frontier, a place where life was sometimes cheap... but honor was always priceless. When it comes to keeping the peace, former frontier sheriff Bob Valdez has always been the voice of reason in a sea of chaos. But Frank Tanner (Jon Cypher) is a very different sort of man: greedy, impulsive and rotten to the core. So when Tanner provokes a shootout that results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez orders him to provide financial support for the widow. But when Tanner not only refuses but also laughs in his face, Valdez dusts off his old uniform, straps on his guns and vows to exact justice and vengeance at any cost.",

            "description": "Mrs. Brisby, a widowed mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbon farm. She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, yet plot to kill Nicodemus during the move.",

He's slowly becoming a terrifying alien entity with a one-track mind – to procreate with human women! When countless women suffer gruesome deaths while bearing half-alien offspring, scientist Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and hired assassin Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) use Eve (Natasha Henstridge), a more tempered alien clone, to find Ross and his virulent brood. But they underestimate Eve's maternal drive, and before long she escapes to mate with Ross in order to create a pure, unstoppable race that could spell doom for mankind. As time is running out, the ultimate battle takes place in a chilling climax that puts Darwin's theory to the ultimate test...only the strongest species will survive.",

Soon the entire town is overwhelmed by the inhuman horror, but it won't stop there. In a terrifying race for his life, Dr. Bennell escapes to warn the world of the deadly invasion of the pod people! Remade in both 1978 and 1997, this chilling combination of extraterrestrial terror and anti-conformity paranoia is considered one of the great cult classics of the genre.",

            "description": "Inspired by a true story set in Victorian England, a tale charting the life of Beatrix Potter--a literary phenomenon of the early 20th century. At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage, Beatrix became an iconic figure, swimming quietly, but with great fortitude, against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago, and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and--had she been a man--her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust, the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter's day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation.",

Deadpan rich boy Harold (Bud Cort) keeps staging elaborate suicide      tableaux to get the attention of his mother (Vivian Pickles), but she keeps planning his      brilliant future for him instead. Obsessed with the trappings of death, Harold freaks out his      blind dates, modifies his new sports car to look like a mini-hearse, and attends funerals,      where he meets the spirited Maude (Ruth Gordon). An eccentric to the core, Maude lives exactly      as she pleases, with avid collecting and nude modeling among her many pursuits. To the disgust      of Harold's relatives and the befuddlement of Harold's shrink, Harold falls in love with her.      As lilting Cat Stevens tunes play on the soundtrack, Maude teaches Harold a valuable lesson      about making the most of his time on earth.",

Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) is still haunted by her failure to save the life of a missing child from the hands of two young girls. Eight years later, another child goes missing in the same town just days after Ronnie and Alice (Dakota Fanning and newcomer Danielle Macdonald), the two girls convicted of the former crime, were released from juvenile detention. Porter and her partner (Nate Parker) must race against the clock to prevent history from repeating itself. But as they begin to investigate the girls and their families, especially Alice's protective mother (Diane Lane), they unearth a web of secrets and deceptions that calls everything into question.",

Halfway up the mountain, their chair lift stops, the lights go out and the resort closes for the week. They are stranded, but the worst is still to come. A storm is approaching. Frostbite is setting in. And on the ground below them, a pack of hungry wolves has gathered to wait. Kevin Zegers (DAWN OF THE DEAD, WRONG TURN), Shawn Ashmore (X-MEN, THE RUINS) and Emma Bell star in the relentlessly chilling thriller from writer/director Adam Green (HATCHET) that Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News hails as \"a vicious, scary and horrifying experience...FROZEN is a howling good time!\"",

So when; on a whim; he proposes to a vivacious stranger (Isla Fisher); what follows is nothing short of outright insanity as there are disapproving parents; neurotic friends and an ill-advised prison break to deal with before the big day even arrives...if it ever does! Make no mistake; this uproariously over-the-top comedy shows once and for all why \"love\" is truly a four-letter word! Pantoliano; Joanna Gleason; Edward Hermann and Rob Corddry also star!",

The confusion and intensity of a single moment in war are captured in this intense and bloody WWII drama about the destruction of a single vital bridge (the Ludendorff Bridge) at Remagen.  As American forces move into Germany, the Nazi high command orders the bridge destroyed.  A German major (Robert Vaughn), realizing the destruction of the bridge will cut his troops off from their homeland, delays the carrying out of his orders.  The Americans, under officer George Segal, are ordered to capture the German troops and, if needed, blow up the bridge themselves.  A deadly clash of conscience and arms begins.",

            "description": "Widely considered the most influential hip-hop movie of all time, this \"gritty, streetwise musical\" (LA Herald-Examiner) features a who's who of the movement's early stars Kool DJ Herc, Kool Moe Dee, Doug E. Fresh, Afrika Bambaataa and Melle Melas well as the famous Rocky Steady Crew vs. New York City Breakers battle at the Roxy. Uniting the four elements of hip-hop break dancing, DJ-ing, MC-ing and graffiti into an unforgettable experience, Beat Street is a true classic, packed with sharp lyrics, powerful moves and the flashiest dance sets the screen has ever seen!  When rapper-DJ Kenny (Guy Davis) meets cultured jazz artist Tracy (Rae Dawn Chong), he is so inspired by her dedication that he vows to use his talents to escape the ghetto. But when his friend, a gifted graffiti artist, is killed in a tragic accident, Kenny comes face to face with the high price of artistic passion.",

At the wheel of this unstoppable beast is Ice-T, who takes us on a personal journey into the asphalt roots of the music that saved his life.   This film is not about stardom, bling, or beef; it's about the craft and skill - what goes on inside the minds and erupts from the lips of rap legends.  Ice-T travels from coast to coast, engaging intimately with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa, Eminem, Nas, Mos Def, Kanye West, Chuck D, KRS-One, Snoop Dogg, Run-DMC, and Ice Cube.  The film features original rapping and some classic never heard before a cappellas from the mouths of the creators.  What emerges is a mighty soul tribute to the original American art form that brought poetry to a new generation.\n MPAA Rating: R  2012 The Art of Rap Films LTD",

David Halloran (Harrison Ford), a courageous American bomber pilot, and a British nurse (Lesley-Anne Down) accidentally meet during an air raid and fall instantly in love. Committed to an assignment, David asks her to meet him two weeks later in spite of the fact that she is married. And she does. Her husband, Paul Sellinger (Christopher Plummer), is a British intelligence officer in charge of a special, dangerous mission behind enemy lines. As fate would have it, Halloran is chosen to fly Sellinger on the task. When their plane is shot down, the two must work together to complete the mission - and it is only then that Halloran discovers who Sellinger is. © 1979 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to complete terror as he discovers the entities' sole purpose... the abduction of his seven year old son.  In the end, John will uncover the town's horrific secret, a portal on his land, and make one last attempt to save his son before the shadow people permanently take him away to their world.",

Ray (Elle Fanning) is a teenager who knows he's a boy, even though he was assigned female at birth. Ray has already been living as a boy for years, but is now ready to start hormone replacement therapy. His single mother, Maggie (Naomi Watts), must track down Ray's biological father (Tate Donovan) to get his legal consent to allow Ray's transition. Dolly (Susan Sarandon), Ray's lesbian grandmother is having a hard time accepting that she now has a grandson. They must each confront their own identities and learn to embrace change and their strength as a family in order to ultimately find acceptance and understanding.",

            "description": "With no job security and a bleak future, Paul Dynan (Kevin Zegers of TV's GOSSIP GIRL) plans the perfect crime to help his struggling family extort a fortune from three wealthy men (including Ray Liotta of GOODFELLAS, Victor Garber of TV's DECEPTION). The plan: Abduct their socialite children (including Laura Vandervoort of TV's SMALLVILLE, Dustin Milligan of TV's 90210) and collect a healthy ransom of $3 million. Over the course of one long night, Paul and his accomplices hold the rich kids hostage. Awaiting the ransom, they have little idea of the secrets that will surface when the parents are forced to choose between their children and their money. Once blood is shed and things go horribly wrong, Paul must fight to stay one step ahead of his own twisted game.",

Former police detective David Paulides was initially brought on to investigate the circumstances around the many mysterious disappearances - here he presents the haunting true stories of hunters experiencing the unexplainable. Missing 411: The Hunted is based on the book by Paulides, which documents 185 cases of missing peoples from four different countries. All 185 cases fit a narrowly defined profile that was refined after researching thousands of missing person reports; these cases are the most difficult, defy common sense, challenge conventional wisdom and remain unexplained.",

It Might Get Loud tells the personal stories, in their own words, of three generations of electric guitar virtuosos -- The Edge (U2), Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), and Jack White (The White Stripes). It reveals how each developed his unique sound and style of playing favorite instruments, guitars both found and invented. Concentrating on the artist's musical rebellion, traveling with him to influential locations, provoking rare discussion as to how and why he writes and plays, this film lets you witness intimate moments and hear new music from each artist. The movie revolves around a day when Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge first met and sat down together to share their stories, teach and play. 2009 Steel Curtain Pictures, LLC.

Set in German East Africa just prior to World War I; \"Shout at the Devil\" is the story of Flynn O'Flynn (Marvin) and Sebastian Oldsmith (Moore); two men who have teamed up on a series of illicit poaching raids. Their actions soon catch the eye of German Commissioner Herman Fleischer; who uses his authority to enact a terrible punishment. O'Flynn and Oldsmith embark on a personal campaign against Fleischer; eventually being recruited by the allied forces to take on an even bigger target-an elusive German battleship. Also starring Ian Holm (\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\") and Barbara Parkins (\"Asylum\"); \"Shout at the Devil\" is an exciting mix of humor; action; and the unique chemistry shared between two of Hollywood's finest stars.",

            "description": "When a gunman killed five Amish children and injured five others in a Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania schoolhouse shooting in October of 2006, the world media attention rapidly turned from the tragic events to the extraordinary forgiveness demonstrated by the Amish community. Through the eyes of a grieving mother, Ida Graber, and other devastated families, this movie explores the Amish's astonishing reaction to the horrific shootings - of forgiveness and compassion.",

Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, a special unit highly trained in martial arts and the precise physical skills necessary to navigate the treacherous urban landscape of Paris' future. He is now tasked with the most vital and dangerous mission of his career: to retrieve a loose nuke stolen by the most powerful gang of District B13. Leïto, a vigilante criminal whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang, knows District B13 like the back of his hand. Assigned to infiltrate the sector to defuse the bomb, Damien must convince Leïto to join his cause. Yet everything is not quite as it seems. Who exactly works for whom? Who is really pulling the strings? Above all, who profits from the use of this bomb? ",

            "description": "\"A study of crazy brilliance and flamboyant sincerity\" (Los Angeles Herald-Examiner), \"a.k.a Cassius Clay\" presents a fascinating look at the incredible life and achievements of one of the most courageous, outspoken and charismatic figures of boxing: Muhammad Ali. Born Cassius Clay in 1942, Ali soon rose to become a renowned athlete, an articulate author and a compelling political leader. Audacious, ambitious and totally fearless, Ali became a symbol of pride, a legend of hope and one of the most extraordinary icons of the 20th century. This \"provocative\" (Boxoffice) documentary charts the voyage of a man who grabbed Olympic gold at the age of 18, captured the World Heavyweight title at 21, and ultimately came to power as one of the most forceful leaders of the American civil rights movement. Features clips from his most hailed fights with Archie Moore and Sonny Liston, rare interviews with his trainer Cus D'Amato, and extraordinary footage of Ali during his alliance with Malcolm X.",

But when she returns later to pick him up, he has mysteriously vanished. The police can't help her. Her friends – who have never met him – don't believe her.

            "description": "From a captive planet two million light years away came a desperate message from space...help us! On the verge of annihilation, Kido, the leader of the persecuted Jillucians, sends his beautiful granddaughter, Emeralida, to find the eight legendary brave warriors who alone can stop the steel-skinned hordes of the Gavanas Empire! This disparate, rag-tag group (a drunken general, a deposed prince, space hot rodders, a hoodlum, a royal retainer, and a broken-down robot) must band together before it's too late - before the Gavanas can reach their next target: Earth! Bristling with dazzling special effects, this wildly colorful, anachronistic Space Opera is directed by Kinji Fukasaku and told in an ancient fairy-tale style. It features a stellar international cast, including Vic Morrow, Sonny Chiba, Hiroyuki Sanada, Etsuko Shihomi, Tetsuro Tamba, and Philip Casnoff . \"Message From Space\" is a spectacular sci-fi adventure, where fantasies are real...and reality is fantastic!",
